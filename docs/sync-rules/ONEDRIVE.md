### Overview

The advanced sync rules consists of a set of rules where each rule can have one or more parameters out of these:

1. owners: list of user emails of the owners for which the rule would execute.
2. skipFilesWithExtensions: list of file extensions to be skipped for the sync.
3. parentPathPattern: glob pattern specifying the path where the files to be synced are present.

# Outlook Connector

The [Elastic Outlook connector](../connectors/sources/outlook.py) is built with the Elastic connectors Python framework and is available as a self-managed [connector client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/build-connector.html).

## Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a **connector client** from the **Python connectors framework**. To use this connector, satisfy all [connector client requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/master/build-connector.html).

This connector is in **beta** and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Usage

To use this connector as a **connector client**, use the **Outlook** tile from the connectors list OR **Customized connector** workflow.

For additional operations, see [Usage](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/master/connectors-usage.html).

## Connecting to Outlook

Outlook connector supports both cloud (Office365 Outlook) and on-premises (Exchange Server) platforms.

### Connect to Exchange Server

In order to connect to Exchange server, the connector fetches Active Directory users with the help of `ldap3` python library.

### Connect to Office365 Outlook (Outlook Cloud)

To integrate with the Outlook connector using Azure, follow these steps to create and configure an Azure application:

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in using your credentials.
2. Click on **App registrations** to register a new application.
3. Navigate to the **Overview** tab. Make a note of the `Client ID` and `Tenant ID`.
4. Click on the **Certificates & secrets** tab and create a new client secret. Keep this secret handy.
5. Go to the **API permissions** tab.
   - Click on "Add permissions."
   - Choose "APIs my organization uses."
   - Search for and select "Office 365 Exchange Online."
   - Add the `full_access_as_app` application permission.

You can now use the Client ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret you've noted to configure the Outlook connector.

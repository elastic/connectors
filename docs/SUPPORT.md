# Getting Support

### Official Support Services
If you have an Elastic subscription, you are entitled to Support services. See our welcome page for [working with our support team](https://www.elastic.co/support/welcome).

### Where do I report issues with Connectors?
If something is not working as expected, please open an [issue](https://github.com/elastic/connectors-python/issues/new).

### Where else can I go to get help?
The Ingestion team at Elastic maintains this repository and is happy to help. Try posting your question to the [Elastic discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/enterprise-search/84). Be sure to mention that you're using Connectors and also let us know what service type you're trying to use, and any errors/issues you are encountering. You can also find us in the `#enterprise-search` channel of the [Elastic Community Slack](http://elasticstack.slack.com).

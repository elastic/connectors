### Setup

You need to specify values for the following variables:

- `ES_HOST_PORT`: Specifies the host and port of your Elasticsearch instance you want to test against (example: `http://localhost:9200`).
- `ES_USER`: Specifies the user, which should be used to authenticate against the Elasticsearch instance (example: `elastic`).
- `ES_PASSWORD`: Specifies the password, which should be used to authenticate against the Elasticsearch instance (example: `password`).

**Note: the postman collection uses basic auth per default.**

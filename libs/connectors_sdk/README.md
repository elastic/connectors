# Connectors SDK

The Connectors SDK is a framework for writing data connectors. This library is a dependency of the Connectors service found under `app/connectors_service`.

Furthermore, you can use this SDK as a standalone framework to author simple data source connectors without having to ingest data directly into Elasticsearch.

In this folder you will find:
- A `pyproject.toml` file
- The connectors framework code
